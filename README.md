## At Home ELISS Push-up Machine
This project showcases an at-home simulation of Singapore's IPPT ELISS Machine, with the goal of allowing NSFs and NSmen to remotely experience the push-up station.
The ELISS machine is frequently feedbacked as inaccurate and may result in no-counts due to the user's push-up posture.
As such, the At Home ELISS Push-up Machine aims to provide feedback regarding the user’s posture, with the goal of improving the user’s push up accuracy for the ELISS machine.
